# Cluster for Student Applicants using **K-Means** Algorithm

## Objective :mag:
 :student: Applying the powerful K-means clustering algorithm to a comprehensive set of applicant features, including GRE and TOEFL scores, university rating, Statement of Purpose (SOP), Letters of Recommendation (LOR), Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), research experience, and the chance of admission probability, enables us to uncover inherent patterns and groupings within the diverse pool of graduate program applicants.

## About Dataset :page_facing_up:
Dataset contains information about applicants and their respective chances of being admitted to a graduate program, with various features providing details about their academic background, test scores, and other relevant aspects.

**GRE Score:** This is likely the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score, which is a standardized test widely used for graduate admissions in the United States and many other countries. It assesses verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing skills.

**TOEFL Score:** This is probably the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score. It measures the English proficiency of non-native speakers who wish to enroll in English-speaking universities.

**University Rating:** This could represent the ranking or reputation of the university from which the applicant obtained their previous degree. It might be a numerical value indicating the university's perceived quality.

**SOP (Statement of Purpose):** This is likely a subjective document written by the applicant, explaining their reasons for pursuing a particular program, their academic and research interests, and career goals.

**LOR (Letters of Recommendation):** These are reference letters written by individuals who can vouch for the applicant's qualifications, usually professors or employers.

**CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average):** This is a measure of a student's academic performance, typically on a scale of 0 to 4.0.

**Research:** This binary variable (0 or 1) may indicate whether the applicant has research experience. Research experience can be a significant factor in graduate admissions, especially for research-focused programs.

**Chance of Admit:** This is likely the target variable or dependent variable, representing the probability or likelihood of the applicant being admitted to the graduate program. It could be expressed as a percentage or a value between 0 and 1.
